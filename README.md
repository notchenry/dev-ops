>How to make money from something you give away for free?

This article talks about how open source software is used almost everywhere and how companies have shifted their business strategies in order to make money from the open source software, but not lose their communal values. Last summer I worked with primarily open source software, and this is something I always wondered about but never followed through with finding out the answers. One of the ways that companies have done this is by selling support. Another is to sell proprietary software based on the open source components. To protect against other companies selling their open source code in a bundle, many companies are now starting to restrict how others can use their software. There will always be tensions between the business models of these open source companies and the communities they come with, but the key (which all developers are hoping to find) is a perfect balance to keep both the world running with all this open source code, and give the developers that made it proper credit. This is a conversation that developers should all be having.

Comments:
Great article! It was interesting how companies want to make money by welling the extensions good enough so customers will need the company's proprietary offerings since if the open source is too good, customers will no longer pay for the add-ons.

>I think you brought up an interesting conversation about how developers should share their work. Businessed tend to limit others because of value in their product. AWS, for example, has free trials, but with limited usage. This is smart for both sides because developers can test out the software and decide if they want to use it or not for their own project, and they don't have to pay if they don't like the product.
